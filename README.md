3.  **Select tools** from the left-side tool palette.
4.  **Adjust settings** like color, brush size, and font size using the options provided.
5.  **Create or join rooms** for collaborative sessions.

### Creating a Collaboration Room

1.  Click **"Create Room"** in the room manager (typically located at the top-right).
2.  Enter a **room name** and choose desired privacy settings (public/private).
3.  **Share the generated link** with your collaborators.
4.  Start collaborating in real-time with your team\!

### Joining a Room

2.  Enter the **room ID** when prompted (if not using a direct link).
3.  Begin collaborating with other users instantly.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Tools

1.  Define the new tool type in `src/types/whiteboard.ts`.
2.  Implement the tool's logic and behavior within `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`.
3.  Update the user interface in `src/components/ToolPalette.tsx` to include the new tool.

### Styling Modifications

  - Modify `tailwind.config.js` for theme customization and global styling adjustments.
  - Update individual component styles in their respective `.tsx` or `.css` files.
  - Adjust color schemes directly in the tool palette or through CSS variables.

### Real-time Integration

The current implementation includes a simulation for real-time features. To integrate actual real-time functionality:

1.  Set up a WebSocket server (Socket.io is a recommended library).
2.  Replace the existing simulation logic with actual WebSocket connections and event handling.
3.  Implement server-side room management and state synchronization logic.
